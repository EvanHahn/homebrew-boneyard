# How to Contribute

Casks should be added here after being deleted from one of the other
repositories due to unknown failures such as the vendor site going down.

If the product is known to be canceled and will never be available, there is
no need to submit a copy here.  Such Casks can be deleted outright.

If you find a Cask here that can be brought back to working form, please submit
it to the [main repository](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask), or
one of the other Caskroom repositories as appropriate.

Once brought back to life, the boneyard copy should be deleted.

See also the [instructions for contributing](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
in the main repository.
